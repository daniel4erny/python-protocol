This repository is made for a fun project about making my own "protocol"

The "Client" folder is for everything that is on the client side, althought it only
uses the packet.py and client.py files

The "Server" folder, has database functions, server itself and the .db file, because
I am using SQLite

The "Test" folder, is a folder for testing (mainly making ui)

"web" folder is for making my own https server from scratch
